# Nvidia GPU Sales Performance Analysis - Project Overview

## The goal of this project is to analyze Nvidia GPU sales data across various market segments, regions, and sales channels to inform strategic decision-making for optimizing sales performance and identifying future growth opportunities.

Nvidia is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a wide range of markets, including gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive. Understanding the dynamics of GPU sales across these diverse segments and geographical regions is crucial for Nvidia to maintain its market leadership, identify growth areas, and navigate potential challenges. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights into sales trends, market segment performance, and channel effectiveness to support strategic planning for future sales initiatives. The project focuses on two primary objectives: 1) to understand the revenue and unit sales performance across different market segments (e.g., Data Center/AI, Gaming, Professional Visualization), and 2) to identify key trends and potential drivers impacting sales growth or decline over time and across geographical regions.

## Dataset Structure

The analysis utilized a collection of aggregated internal sales performance datasets covering the period from 2023 to 2025, including information on sales metrics, market segments, and GPU models.

## Insights Summary

In order to evaluate sales performance, we focused on the following key metrics:

* **Year-over-Year (YoY) Revenue Growth Rate**: The percentage change in total revenue compared to the previous year.
* **Total Revenue by Market Segment**: The absolute revenue generated by each of Nvidia's key market segments.
* **Sales Performance by Region and Market Segment (Monthly)**: Monthly revenue trends broken down by geographical region and market segment.
* **Average Selling Price (ASP) by Market Segment**: The average revenue per unit sold within each market segment.

**Year-over-Year (YoY) Revenue Growth Rate**
* From 2023 to 2025, the YoY revenue growth rate has been rapidly decreasing, dropping by -16.53% from 2023 to 2024 to -75.54% from 2024 to 2025.
* The Data Center/AI market segment suffered massive decreases in revenue in comparison to other market segments which only experienced relatively small declines.

**Total Revenue by Market Segment**
* Across all regions, Europe and North America experienced the lowest subscription rate at a rate of 68.45% and 68.90% respectively.
* The Plus Tiers all experienced a very similar amount of subscriptions, averaging to around 23% per Plus tiers (Essential, Extra, and Premium), with roughly 30% of all PlayStation users having no subscription plan at all.
* Overall, the total subscription rate of users is the highest among fresh members, and it consistently gets lower the older an active PlayStation user is, starting at 74.4% for fresh members, waning off to 69.3% for legacy members (older than a year).

**Sales Performance by Region and Market Segment (Monthly)**
* The most played titles available in the PlayStation were Fortnite, GTA V, and Marvel's Spider Man, ranging from 105k, 100k, 96k gaming sessions respectively.
* Fortnite had the highest amount of gaming sessions, which could be due to quick match times causing frequent closing and opening of this game.
* Adventure genre games tend to have less gaming sessions per user, but experience longer playtimes per session.

**Average Selling Price (ASP) by Market Segment**
* On average, each PlayStation user spent around 60 minutes per gaming session across all subscription types and games.
* Action genres and subgenres had the longest playtime sessions, averaging to well over 2 hours per session, which is 2x the amount of average playtime sessions.
* Certain games like Final Fantasy, Elden Ring, NieR Automata, and Minecraft had the highest average playtime compare to other popular titles with more frequent shorter sessions.

## Recommendations

* Introductory Offers: Explore limited-time offers or exclusive content for new subscribers, who has the highest subscription rate among users. Subsequently, analyze user activity patterns and survey churned users to understand why users churn around the 1-3 month mark.
* Loyalty Rewards Program: Introduce new benefits like loyalty rewards for long-term subscribers to incentivize Plus members to stay for longer periods and reward our tenured members.
* Regional Marketing Strategies: Investigate Europe and North America regions to understand their low subscription rates. Collect user data on regional pricing and attitudinal data on communication quality in these regions.
* Game-Specific Opportunities: Offer exclusive in-game content, discounts, or early access to expansions for the popular titles for PlayStation Plus subscribers to incentivize joining the PlayStation ecosystem.

## Dashboard

The dashboard can be found in Tableau Public [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/celine.nguyen7574/viz/NVIDIAGPUSalesPerformance/NVIDIAGPUSalesPerformance). This dashboard enables users to filter by Plus Tiers and focuses on trends and values in subscription metrics, churn rate metrics, and game popularity metrics.
