# Nvidia GPU Sales Performance Analysis - Project Overview

## The goal of this project is to analyze Nvidia GPU sales data across various market segments, regions, and sales channels to inform strategic decision-making for optimizing sales performance and identifying future growth opportunities.

Nvidia is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a wide range of markets, including gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive. Understanding the dynamics of GPU sales across these diverse segments and geographical regions is crucial for Nvidia to maintain its market leadership, identify growth areas, and navigate potential challenges. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights into sales trends, market segment performance, and channel effectiveness to support strategic planning for future sales initiatives. The project focuses on two primary objectives: 1) to understand the revenue and unit sales performance across different market segments (e.g., Data Center/AI, Gaming, Professional Visualization), and 2) to identify key trends and potential drivers impacting sales growth or decline over time and across geographical regions.

## Dataset Structure

The analysis utilized a collection of aggregated internal sales performance datasets covering the period from 2023 to 2025, including information on sales metrics, market segments, and GPU models.

## Insights Summary

In order to evaluate sales performance, we focused on the following key metrics:

* **Year-over-Year (YoY) Revenue Growth Rate**: The percentage change in total revenue compared to the previous year.
* **Total Revenue by Market Segment**: The absolute revenue generated by each of Nvidia's key market segments.
* **Sales Performance by Region and Market Segment (Monthly)**: Monthly revenue trends broken down by geographical region and market segment.
* **Average Selling Price (ASP) by Market Segment**: The average revenue per unit sold within each market segment.

**Year-over-Year (YoY) Revenue Growth Rate**
* From 2023 to 2025, the YoY revenue growth rate has been rapidly decreasing, dropping by -16.53% from 2023 to 2024 to -75.54% from 2024 to 2025.
* The Data Center/AI market segment suffered massive decreases in revenue in comparison to other market segments which only experienced relatively small declines when comparing total revenue contribution.
* Overall, all market segments experienced significant YoY revenue growth decline, affecting NVIDIA's growth negatively.

**Total Revenue by Market Segment**
* Across all market segments, Data Center/AI generated the most revenue, totalling to 84.95% of NVIDIA's total revenue.
* Professional Visualization contributes the second most to NVIDIA's revenue at 8.02%, which is 10x smaller in comparison to Data Center/AI.
* When combined, all the Gaming segments (ranging from Entry-Level to High-End) total to 6.21% of NVIDIA's total revenue. Despite not generating a majority of the revenue, the Gaming segment has comparable unit sales to the previous two segments.

**Sales Performance by Region and Market Segment (Monthly)**
* Sales performance by region and market segment revealed a peak in the earlier months of 2023, which then fluctuated with an overall downward trend towards 2025.
* There are different performance levels across Asia, Europe, and North America for various market segments.
* OEM/Embedded experienced the strongest fluctuation in monthly revenue versus the Gaming segments, which fluctuated the least compared to other segments.

**Average Selling Price (ASP) by Market Segment**
* A majority of the unit sales for GPUs were from the Gaming segment, despite having lower ASP ($1071.33) in comparison to Data Center/AI ($19,027).
* Professional Visualization shows relatively high ASP ($1,848) and unit sales (89k).
* OEM/Embedded has lower ASP ($737) and unit sales (22k) compared to others, but still represents a consistent part of NVIDIA.

## Recommendations

* OEM/Embedded Growth: Expand sales and market presence in the OEM/Embedded segment, like potential for customization or specialized solutions.
* Investigate Drivers: Investigate drivers behind declining revenue generation, such as demand in specific market segments or new product releases from competitors.
* Gaming Segment: Monitor and leverage the high sales volume in the Gaming segment for continued growth and profitability. This could include encouraging gamers to upgrade to high-end GPUs or explore our other products.
* Professional Visualization Segment: Expand on the RTX A6000 and RTX A6000 Ada, as these GPU models make up a significant portion of the segment's total revenue generation outside of Data Center/AI.

## Dashboard

The dashboard can be found in Tableau Public [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/celine.nguyen7574/viz/NVIDIAGPUSalesPerformance/NVIDIAGPUSalesPerformance). This dashboard enables users to filter by Market Segment and focuses on trends and values in revenue metrics, gpu performance metrics, and unit sales metrics.
